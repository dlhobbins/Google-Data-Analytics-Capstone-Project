## Ask phase
Business Task: A junior data analyst working for Bellabeat has been tasked with analysing smart device usage data, from non-Bellabeat products in order to gain insights into the trends of smart device usage. 
These insights will then be applied to one of Bellabeats products in order to see how these insights could be applied to Bellabeat customers and drive future marketing strategies. Urška Sršen, the cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that these insights could unlock potential future growth for the company.

The stakeholders include: 
Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s co founder and Chief Creative Officer

## Prepare phase
ROCCC
The data set used for this analysis is the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker information from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. The dataset is from a reliable source. Being collected directly from the 30 users that participated, the data is original. With minute level output for each user the data can be considered comprehensive. The data was collected between April 12th and May 12th 2016 so it is outdated and may not reflect the current trends of smart device usage. The data was gathered by Mobius.
